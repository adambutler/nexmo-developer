Quickstarts also available for: [Java](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-java-quickstart), [.NET](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-dotnet-quickstart), [Node.js](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-node-quickstart), [PHP](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-php-quickstart), [Python](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-python-quickstart) 

The purpose of the quickstart guide is to provide simple examples focused
on one goal. For example, sending and SMS, handling and incoming SMS webhook,
making a Text to Speech call.

## Setup

To use this sample you will first need a [Nexmo account][sign-up]. Then rename
the `.env-example` file to `.env` and set the values as required.

For some of the examples you will need to [buy a number][buy-number].

## Running the Examples

Run the examples using the following replacing `/path/to/example.rb` with a path
to a real file:

```sh
ruby /path/to/example.rb
```
